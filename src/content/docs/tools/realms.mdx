Realms is the one-stop platform that is aimed at the management of on-chain governance for DAOs on Solana. Realms is a secure, transparent, and decentralized environment and serves as the central hub for governance activity within IslandDAO.

#### GOVERNANCE PARTICIPATION

All $ISLAND token holders are eligible to participate in the governance process. Voting power is directly tied to the amount of $ISLAND held, enabling community-driven decision-making.

**To vote:** Simply deposit $ISLAND tokens onto Realms to receive voting power. You can cast a “Yes” or “No” vote on active proposals.

**To propose:** You must have a minimum of 100,000 $ISLAND tokens deposited as voting power to create a new proposal on Realms.

**IslandDAO operates a hybrid governance model:**

Multi-Sig Voting is used by the Council for key decisions.

Token-Based Voting is used by the Community, with defined quorum and approval thresholds.

#### KEY FEATURES OF REALMS:

- **Voting Transparency:** View active proposals, voting periods, quorum requirements, and approval thresholds in real time.
- **Treasury Overview:** Access a full breakdown of the IslandDAO treasury and token holdings through the Dean’s List DAO Realms Treasury.
- **Delegation:** Semi-active members can delegate their voting power to more engaged participants via Realms, ensuring consistent representation.
- **Immutability:** All decisions and votes are recorded on-chain, ensuring transparency and tamper-proof governance.

Through Realms, IslandDAO remains community-led and accountable. By empowering token holders to shape the future of the DAO, Realms strengthens the democratic foundation of our decentralized ecosystem.
