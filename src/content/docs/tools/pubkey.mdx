PubKey is an open-source identity and access management tool developed by **Beeman**, a core contributor at Island DAO. It is the primary system we use internally to manage role assignments within the Island DAO Discord server.

#### HOW IT WORKS

When you connect your wallet to PubKey, it scans for specific on-chain assets and automatically assigns roles to your Discord ID based on the tokens or NFTs held. This enables real-time, asset-based access control - no manual role management required.

- Hold a Gen 1 NFT? Youâ€™re tagged with "One of Us".
- Own a PERKS (Gen 2) NFT? You get the "PERKS" role.
- Hold $ISLAND tokens? You receive the "$ISLAND Holder" role.
- Deposited up-to 100k $ISLAND tokens in realms? You get the "voter" tag.

PubKey ensures secure, automated, and persistent access without the need for repeated wallet reconnections.

#### WHAT'S COMING NEXT

PubKey is evolving with new features that deepen its utility across DAOs. A new upgrade would be live soon - Collections module, which will allow members to browse the Gen 2 NFT collection, see the perks associated with owned NFTs and also have a visual, storefront-style display for DAO assets with marketplace integrations to allow people buy their way into the DAO. PubKey brings automation, transparency, and user-friendliness to role management within Island DAO.
