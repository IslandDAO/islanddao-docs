Metaplex is the leading protocol for creating, managing, and interacting with on-chain assets on the Solana blockchain. It provides the foundational infrastructure for thousands of decentralized applications, NFTs, and communities across the Solana ecosystem. Metaplex serves as the backbone for many NFT and metadata standards on Solana, making it an essential tool for developers and DAOs alike.

#### HOW IT WORKS

IslandDAO leverages Metaplex CORE infrastructure in building and deploying its digital assets. Our PERKS NFT (Gen 2) collection was created using Metaplex’s modular tools, incorporating:

- **Autograph Plugin** – For verified, signature-based metadata.
- **Attribute Plugin** – For dynamic, user-specific traits and metadata.
- **Update Delegate Plugin** – Allowing flexible and secure updates to NFT metadata.

This modularity gives IslandDAO the flexibility and control needed to evolve and maintain NFT utilities over time. Metaplex is more than just a tool, it’s a long-standing strategic partner of IslandDAO. Their support has been instrumental in the success of major initiatives, including IslandDAO v1 and v2 IRL events. By building with Metaplex, IslandDAO ensures its on-chain assets are secure, extensible, and aligned with Solana’s most robust infrastructure standards.
