Governance is at the heart of what defines us. Our goal is to make participation **easy, effective, and fair**, experimenting with different on-chain governance frameworks that give citizens real influence over the DAO’s evolution.

<Image src={gov1} alt="IslandDAO governance" />

Our governance mechanisms combine **token-based**, **Sowellian**, and **Futarchy** models, all powered by the **$ISLAND** token.  
This multi-framework approach makes IslandDAO the first DAO to experiment with all three systems in parallel, pioneering new ways of achieving decentralized decision-making.

#### Governance Participation

All **$ISLAND token holders** are eligible to participate in IslandDAO governance.  
Voting power is directly proportional to the amount of $ISLAND held or locked within Realms, enabling open and community-driven decision-making.

- **To vote:** Deposit $ISLAND tokens onto [Realms](https://v2.realms.today/dao/F9V4Lwo49aUe8fFujMbU6uhdFyDRqKY54WpzdpncUSk9/proposals) to receive voting power. You can cast a _Yes_ or _No_ vote on active proposals.
- **To propose:** You must have a minimum of **100,000 $ISLAND** tokens deposited as voting power to create a new proposal on Realms.

IslandDAO operates a **hybrid governance model**:

- **Multi-Sig Voting** — Managed by a five-member **Council**, elected by the community. Each council member holds a unique Council Token that enables voting on multi-sig proposals and hardcoded veto power to block malicious or security-risk proposals.
- **Token-Based Voting** — Open to all citizens via Realms, with defined quorum and approval thresholds.

  Token-Based Governance
</h4>

IslandDAO uses the open-source **SPL Governance** smart contract on **Solana**, accessed through the **Realms** interface.  
Here, $ISLAND tokens are deposited to vote on proposals related to:

- Treasury management
- Community initiatives
- Council elections and governance upgrades

We use a **VSR (Vote Stake Registry) plugin**, allowing members to optionally lock their tokens for a set period and receive a **voting power multiplier** based on the duration of the lock-up.  
All votes and results are recorded transparently on-chain.

  />
  Sowellian Governance
</h4>

**Sowellian Governance** introduces a prediction-based model where citizens bond $ISLAND tokens to propose ideas and attach measurable **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**.  
Members place one-way _YES_ or _NO_ bets (using $ISLAND) that remain locked until the proposal settles.  
If quorum is met and _YES_ outweighs _NO_, the proposed action is executed. After the evaluation window, the KPI outcome determines the winning side.  
Losing stakes are redistributed pro-rata to the winners, with a small rake directed to the treasury.

IslandDAO is the **first community to implement Sowellian Governance** in practice, expanding the boundaries of how decentralized decision-making can function.

    }}
  />
  Futarchy
</h4>

**Futarchy** enables the DAO to trade on the expected outcomes of proposals using $ISLAND.  
Instead of voting directly, members buy and sell outcome tokens in a prediction market that reflects their confidence in a proposal’s success.  
When the market resolves, the proposal associated with the higher-value outcome is automatically enacted.  
This approach allows governance to align with collective intelligence rather than simple majority votes.

#### Treasury Overview

IslandDAO’s treasury is held securely within the **Realms** smart contract, divided into distinct accounts for transparency and operational clarity.  
Each wallet is governed on-chain through token-based proposals and subject to council oversight.

| Treasury                        | Address                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **IslandDAO Treasury**          | 7A6CrNWAFFBpQTBRo5fULibqqB3MouNLgbVBf8D3MJAx |
| **Community Reserve ($ISLAND)** | DY9NzNSbbDJk4NYXN2TBMkF8oBbZaq7UYSy3VzKcviNS |
| **Liquidity Reserve ($ISLAND)** | EZ3V9DRoUpewNyNTyG3ya7TiPwe27XGDCgFHgfXNprJX |

#### The IslandDAO Governance Ethos

Governance at IslandDAO is not static — it’s a **living system** that evolves with the community.  
We treat governance as a continuous experiment, blending on-chain mechanics with social consensus to achieve coordination at scale.  
Every citizen has the right — and the responsibility — to participate in shaping the DAO’s direction, ensuring IslandDAO remains transparent, accountable, and collectively owned.
