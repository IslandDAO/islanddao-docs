The **$ISLAND** token is the foundation of IslandDAO’s on-chain governance.  
It gives every holder a voice in how the DAO evolves, from treasury decisions to new proposals and community initiatives.  
Holding $ISLAND means more than owning a token; it means holding **governance power** in a decentralized, self-governing network of Solana power users.

Decisions shaped through $ISLAND voting include:

- Allocation of treasury funds
- Approval of new projects or partnerships
- Governance framework updates
- Collective decisions related to NFT-linked utilities and community perks
- Funding for community-driven ideas and experiments

All votes and transactions occur transparently on-chain, ensuring collective control rather than centralized management.

#### Why It Matters

Locking the mint and renouncing ownership underline IslandDAO’s commitment to **true decentralization** — no one can alter the supply or seize control.  
Keeping metadata mutable provides flexibility for evolving branding or technical updates without compromising trust.

The $ISLAND token isn’t a speculative asset; it’s a **tool of coordination** that lets citizens propose, vote, and build together...the core mechanism driving IslandDAO’s network-state.
