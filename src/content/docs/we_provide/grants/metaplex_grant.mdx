These grants are specifically tailored for developers and teams building applications, protocols, or tools that integrate directly with the Metaplex protocol. With funding amounts ranging from $5,000 to $35,000, the program is designed not only to provide financial support but also to offer technical resources, ecosystem integration, and exposure to a broader network of partners and investors.

At the heart of these grants are two main funding tracks: **Metaplex Core Grants and MPL 404 Grants**. The Metaplex Core Grant supports projects that utilize the foundational Metaplex smart contract suite. This includes creators building marketplaces, NFT minting platforms, or innovative experiences that go beyond traditional NFTs, such as ticketing platforms, digital identity frameworks, and community engagement tools. If your project builds on or extends the capabilities of the Metaplex Core stack, this grant track offers both capital and guidance to bring your ideas to life.

The MPL 404 Grant, on the other hand, is focused on projects working with the MPL 404 Hybrid DeFi Standard, a novel specification that allows for deeper integration between NFTs and decentralized finance. These grants are perfect for teams exploring composable DeFi applications that involve NFTs, think collateralized NFT lending protocols, fractionalized NFT markets, or mechanisms for staking, rewards, and governance tied to NFT ownership. If your build is straddling the worlds of NFTs and DeFi in a creative and technically sound way, the MPL 404 Grant is designed for you.

MetaplexDAO's vision is not just about funding builds but about growing a robust, community-led innovation engine for the entire ecosystem. These grants prioritize projects that emphasize composability, open-source contributions, and real utility. In addition to capital, selected grantees gain access to technical support such as code reviews, architecture reviews, and even project marketing assistance. This increases the chances of a successful product launch and long-term ecosystem integration.

IslandDAO plays a vital role in this ecosystem by connecting eligible developers and founders to MetaplexDAOâ€™s grant opportunities. By guiding applicants through the grant process, helping them prepare strong submissions, and providing community support, IslandDAO ensures that more builders, have the chance to contribute meaningfully to the growth of Solana. This funding initiative is particularly impactful for early-stage teams, independent developers, and community-driven projects.
