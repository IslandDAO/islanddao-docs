IslandDAO plays a key role in accelerating innovation within the Solana ecosystem by providing a bridge between builders and critical funding opportunities. We facilitate access to grant programs funded by the Solana Foundation and MetaplexDAO, with a strong focus on supporting open-source public goods and empowering decentralized development across regions and disciplines.

By connecting innovators to these grant streams, we contribute to the growth and sustainability of the Solana ecosystem. Our efforts have resulted in:

- **$200K+ in grants awarded**
- **35+ open-source projects funded**
- **20+ communities supported**
- **12+ countries reached**

This impact is not just measured in numbers but in the value of infrastructure, tools, protocols, and community utilities made available to developers worldwide. We remain committed to championing public goods, amplifying grassroots innovation, and ensuring builders, regardless of geography, have access to the resources needed to deliver high-impact solutions on Solana.

#### ABOUT THE GRANTS PROGRAM

The Solana Foundation and MetaplexDAO offer direct funding opportunities designed to support builders working on non-custodial, open-source, and composable technologies. These programs prioritize public goods and tools that have the potential to be adopted by others in the Solana developer ecosystem, whether thatâ€™s infrastructure, documentation, SDKs, analytics, DAO tooling, or community education.

IslandDAO serves as a key entry point for applicants by guiding them through the grant process, ensuring clarity and alignment with the expectations of the respective foundations.

#### APPLICATION GUIDLINES

To be considered for funding, each application must:

- **Clearly define goals and success metrics:** state what your project aims to accomplish and how progress will be measured over time.
- **Provide a detailed budget breakdown:** show where and how the grant funds will be allocated, including development, design, outreach, and infrastructure costs.
- **Highlight team experience and relevant expertise:** explain your background, relevant experience, and qualifications that make your team capable of executing the project.
- **Demonstrate ecosystem relevance:** articulate how your project adds value to the broader Solana ecosystem, whether through open-source contributions, education, or tool development.
- **Share a realistic implementation timeline:** offer a month-by-month or milestone-based schedule that outlines how the project will progress and deliverables will be met.
- **Include relevant past work or demos (if available):** supplement your application with links to GitHub repositories, design files, prototypes, or previously completed projects.

We invite **developers**, **designers**, **community leaders**, **educators**, and **contributors** to apply and take advantage of these structured funding opportunities.
