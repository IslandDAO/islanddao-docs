Decentragrants is a targeted funding initiative by the Solana Foundation aimed at supporting the development of governance tools and infrastructure within the Solana ecosystem. With grants ranging from $1,000 to $15,000, this program offers direct financial support to builders creating solutions that will define the next generation of on-chain coordination and decentralized governance.

It’s not a general-purpose grant stream, it's explicitly focused on governance. Whether it's DAO tooling, governance primitives, security enhancements, or token-based coordination mechanisms, the goal is clear: to push Solana’s governance capabilities to new heights. The Solana Foundation is particularly interested in milestone-based projects, meaning grant recipients are funded progressively based on hitting specific development or implementation targets.

#### THIS PROGRAM EMPHASIZES THREE KEY AREAS:

1. **DAO Tooling Innovation:** Decentragrants is designed to enable experimentation and unlock possibilities in the world of DAO tooling. Projects funded through this stream are expected to provide clear value in how DAOs operate, organize, and make decisions. For example, integrations with existing protocols like SPL-Governance or Squads can help DAOs manage treasuries more efficiently, enable secure multisig operations, or improve proposal mechanisms. If you're building a DAO dashboard, enhancing governance UX, or creating frameworks for composable governance modules, this is your lane.
2. **Censorship-Resistant & Community-Owned Mechanisms:** A major priority of the grant is to foster systems that are resistant to centralized control and capable of standing independently in a decentralized ecosystem. This includes permissionless tooling, identity-agnostic authentication layers, open-source governance SDKs, or decision-making protocols that allow DAOs to operate transparently and without centralized chokepoints.
3. **Infrastructure for Scalable On-Chain Coordination:** As Solana continues to scale, so must its coordination mechanisms. Decentragrants supports projects that aim to improve how users, developers, and DAOs interact on-chain. Think governance notification systems, real-time proposal tracking, token-curated registries, or interoperable plugins that enable DAOs to function more like living, evolving organizations than static clubs. The focus is on sustainable infrastructure that supports long-term ecosystem growth.

This program is ideal for developers, researchers, and innovators already building or planning to build applications directly related to DAOs and governance on Solana. If your product already has traction or a passionate community, and you're ready to extend its utility into governance, be it through smart contract upgrades, new voting systems, or primitives that enhance accountability and transparency, Decentragrants offers you a path to receive non-dilutive funding to realize your vision. Projects that receive support are expected to uphold open-source values and contribute meaningfully to the collective toolkit of the Solana governance ecosystem.
