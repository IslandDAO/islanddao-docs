AthensDAO event was inspired by the concept of Solana Foundation’s Hacker Houses but introduced with a distinct community-first focus. It became the first decentralized, community-organized event to carry forward the hacker house model while infusing it with a deeper exploration into decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and on-chain governance. Its a blend of authentic Solana Foundation Hacker House energy with an intensive dive into the mechanics and implications of DAOs. It’s not just about building, it’s about understanding the frameworks that allow for collective decision-making, tokenized communities, and digitally native governance.

The **two-day conference** is held in Athens, Greece, a city globally recognized as the cradle of democracy and philosophy. The symbolic location reflects our mission to reimagine governance for the digital age. This isn’t just a nod to history; it’s a purposeful effort to bring ancient principles into modern technologies and decentralized networks.

Each year, the event convenes top minds from the Solana ecosystem and beyond. Attendees gain in-person access to core contributors, project founders, Solana Labs engineers, and growth experts who provide mentorship and technical guidance across two full days of learning, hacking, and collaboration. Participants can expect a dynamic mix of keynotes, panel discussions, and technical workshops that span the latest in DAO tooling, crypto labor markets, community infrastructure, on-chain coordination, and practical strategies for DAO deployment.

This event proudly backed by a wide array of ecosystem players, including **Solana Foundation, PubKey, Realms, Bonk, Greed Academy, Solana Turbine, Metaplex, Streamflow, AllDomains, and many others**. This deep ecosystem support ensures that participants not only learn but also plug directly into relevant tools, teams, and funding pipelines that can accelerate their journey in web3.

One of the standout components of AthensDAO is the focus on practical experience. Attendees are encouraged to use the event as a springboard to start building, whether that means forming new teams, collaborating with peers on existing ideas, or polishing a project for demo day. The environment is structured to support meaningful work: a venue with reliable WIFI, dedicated workstations, all-day snacks, relaxation lounges, and a community energized to ship impactful ideas.
