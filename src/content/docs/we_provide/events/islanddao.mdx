IslandDAO is more than a co-working retreat, it’s an entirely new paradigm for how builders in the Solana ecosystem come together to collaborate, innovate, and scale ideas. Inspired by the MTNDAO cohort model, maintaining the same core values of focus, creativity, and camaraderie, but now wrapped in the calm, energizing embrace of nature and island life. This month-long residency brings together some of the most passionate and driven developers, creators, founders, and contributors in the Solana ecosystem. It offers a rare opportunity for deep collaboration in an environment designed to minimize distractions and maximize output, all while encouraging community-building and spontaneous serendipity that’s often missing from traditional hackathons and conferences.

#### A BUILDER-FIRST ISLAND RESIDENCY

IslandDAO operates on a simple but powerful philosophy: build, bond, and break through limitations. For four weeks, attendees live and work side-by-side at a carefully chosen island destination, transforming beachfront villas and workspaces into hubs of innovation. It’s where Solana meets sea and sun, and the results are profound. More like waking up to the sound of ocean waves, grabbing your laptop, and starting your workday with fellow builders from your private poolside desk. With dedicated workspaces, daily planning sessions, and uninterrupted time to ship ideas, teams find themselves solving problems in hours that might otherwise drag on for weeks.

It isn’t just transformative for builders, it’s a golden opportunity for ecosystem **partners and brands**. Through sponsorships, product integrations, panels, or one-on-one sessions, partners become embedded in the narrative of IslandDAO. This kind of organic, high-engagement exposure is difficult to achieve in traditional marketing settings. It’s a chance to seed long-term relationships, gain early user feedback, and co-create with builders in real-time.

#### THE EXPERIENCE

But IslandDAO isn’t just about work, it’s also about experience. Builders can recharge and bond during a wide range of curated activities: beach excursions, windsurfing, fitness sessions, jet skiing, island hikes, sailing, and even rounds of golf. These bonding moments are as valuable as the building time, they spark new ideas, forge long-term relationships, and break down silos between teams. Legendary weekly bonding events are the heartbeat of the IslandDAO vibe. Whether it's a local feast, a treasure hunt around the island, or an impromptu open mic night, these moments ensure that every builder is seen, celebrated, and part of a larger, growing family.

Through the **"Builder of the Day"** series, IslandDAO shines a spotlight on standout contributors. These daily high-exposure video segments capture the essence of the experience, giving builders recognition across the Solana ecosystem and offering partners and communities a front-row seat to the energy and innovation being built on-site. For many, this visibility becomes a launchpad for future collaborations, grants, or investment.
