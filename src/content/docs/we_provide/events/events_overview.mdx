When it comes to representing on Solana, and even beyond it, we are a force to be reckoned with. At every major gathering, whether it’s a Hacker House, Breakpoint, Crossroads, Accelerate, or any of the defining ecosystem events, we don’t just attend, we leave a mark.

Participation for us isn’t passive. We take the stage, we demo, we speak, and most importantly, we showcase what we are actively building within our DAO. Every presence is purposeful, every interaction intentional. We seize these opportunities to connect with other builders, share knowledge, and invite new contributors into our growing community. Side events have become one of our strongest strategies for outreach, casual yet powerful spaces where real connections are made and interest in our mission is sparked.

We understand that attending ecosystem events is not just about visibility, it’s about community building. These gatherings offer fertile ground for networking, collaboration, and recruitment. That’s why we make it a point never to lag behind. Instead, we align ourselves with the rhythm of the ecosystem, ensuring our community is always present where innovation is happening.

But beyond being present, we have our own flagship events that embody our vision and values. **AthensDAO and IslandDAO** are more than just conferences or co-working retreats; they are physical manifestations of the network state we’re building. In the next pages, we’ll take a deeper dive into how these community-led experiences have become central to our impact, onboarding, and growth strategies.
