As we’ve emphasized from the outset, Island DAO stands as the go-to community for founders and emerging projects seeking meaningful, actionable feedback that drives real growth. Within the Solana ecosystem, we are recognized not just as a group of contributors, but as a structured network of experienced Web3 users and evaluators whose insights help shape products into powerful, user-centric solutions.

Founders come to us when they’re looking for more than just surface-level validation, they want depth. They want the kind of engagement that uncovers blind spots, identifies growth opportunities, and helps them avoid costly mistakes before they scale. At Island DAO, we don’t offer passive commentary; we deliver structured, intentional, and data-driven input that leads to measurable improvement and increased traction across the Solana ecosystem.

Our feedback system is designed with flexibility in mind, accommodating the varying needs of the projects we serve. We offer two primary modes of operation: Feedback Review Mode and the Live Bonanza Mode, each tailored to different stages of product development and depth of engagement. These modes will be broken down in detail in the upcoming tabs.

Before diving into the specifics of each feedback type, it’s important to understand how feedback opportunities are sourced.

#### THERE ARE TWO MAIN PATHWAYS:

- **Direct Project Outreach**

  Project teams or founders can approach Island DAO directly by visiting our official website islanddao.org, where they’ll find a menu of service packages, clearly outlined with deliverables and pricing tiers. Whether it’s a startup testing out its MVP or a more established protocol preparing for a new release, our platform allows clients to select feedback services that align with their needs, timelines, and budgets.

- **Community-Sourced Opportunities**

  In the true spirit of decentralization and ownership, Island DAO also empowers its members to bring in clients. Whether through social media engagement, content marketing, or word-of-mouth referrals, any member of the DAO can represent our services and pitch to potential clients. When a deal is secured through such an effort, the DAO compensates the referring member with a percentage-based reward from the total service fee, a model that both incentivizes grassroots outreach and keeps our community active in shaping the direction of the DAO.

Once a client is onboarded, the next phase of the process is determined by their chosen mode of feedback, Review or Live Bonanza. Each route offers a distinct experience for the client, but regardless of the path taken, what remains consistent is the high standard of insight and professionalism we bring to every engagement.

#### Application guidelines

- A **project manager** is assigned to oversee the feedback cycle.
- The manager **posts the project** on our internal dashboard.
- DAO **members opt-in** to contribute based on interest or expertise.
- Members **submit feedback** directly through the platform.
- The manager **curates, synthesizes, and delivers** the final report to the client.
