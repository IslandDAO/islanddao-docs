When speed, depth, and direct engagement matter most, we turn to our Live Bonanza mode, the most dynamic and interactive form of feedback in our toolkit. Built for projects that crave immediate insights and unfiltered responses, Live Bonanza takes feedback out of the document and into the moment.

Unlike Feedback Report, which delivers structured written reports over time, Bonanza sessions happen live. Founders, contributors, and product users gather in a single session to test, evaluate, and refine a product together. It’s fast, focused, and deeply interactive, ideal for teams looking to fix blockers, validate assumptions, or gather feedback before launch.

#### HERE'S HOW IT WORKS NOW:

The session takes place on Riverside.fm, our current go-to platform for hosting live product testing and review sessions. It’s not your typical Zoom call or Twitter Space, Riverside gives us high-quality audio and video, seamless screen sharing, and the stability required to test products without disruption.

#### BENEFITS OF FEEDBACK LIVE BONANZA?

- **Ideal for tight timelines or pre-launch reviews:** Whether you're heading into a mainnet launch, demo day, or investor presentation, it gives you high-signal feedback without the wait. It condenses a week’s worth of feedback into a single, powerful session.
- **Enables rapid iteration and feature/UX flow validation:** Watching people use your product live reveals friction points, flow breakdowns, and moments of delight that can’t be caught in static feedback.
- **You benefit from real-time conversation:** founders get to clarify features, ask follow-ups, or pivot the discussion live. It’s like a moderated focus group, but leaner, sharper, and tailored to builders.
- **You want to involve the community in your build process:** It invites feedback from DAO contributors who bring diverse backgrounds, design, development, community, and more. It’s a space to gather input while building trust and transparency.
- **Helps teams surface UX issues and design flaws:** Even offhand remarks or side comments from members are reviewed, timestamped, and added to the final report, ensuring nothing useful slips through the cracks.
