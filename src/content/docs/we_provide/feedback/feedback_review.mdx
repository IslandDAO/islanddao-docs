This is where the foundation of our feedback system truly lies. The IslandDAO **Feedback Review** is a carefully structured approach that ensures every product receives layered, organized, and deeply thought-through feedback. It has helped us build a reputation as the go-to DAO for product refinement in the Solana ecosystem.

Let’s walk through what happens when a project founder approaches IslandDAO seeking structured insights into their product.

The Feedback Report is IslandDAO’s flagship service designed to help early-stage and scaling projects identify and resolve product-level issues before they reach critical mass. Through this service, teams receive a structured, multi-perspective report that consolidates user insights, flags critical bugs, highlights UX/UI concerns, and offers actionable recommendations.

It draws from the IslandDAO workflow, a curated feedback loop powered by contributors within the DAO. **Any IslandDAO member can participate** based on their experience, interest, and domain knowledge relevant to the product under review. Each session brings together product thinkers, UX researchers, developers, designers, and power users who dissect the product in its current state and provide honest, constructive feedback. The result is a high-signal report that helps founders refine their product faster and avoid costly mistakes before launch or scale.

**The quality? Always high.**
**The structure? It worked.**
**But we knew we could do better.**

Currently, we’ve moved past scattered groups and multiple external tools. And developed internal dashboard, a purpose-built platform designed to manage feedback projects end-to-end in a more sophisticated, streamlined, and professional way.

#### HERE'S HOW IT WORKS NOW:

Instead of creating temporary groups or threads, managers simply post each feedback opportunity as a project on our dashboard. Members can then log in, view all open feedback projects, and choose the one that aligns with their interests or expertise. Once they’ve selected a project, they can submit their feedback directly under the project’s page. With the feedback review now running on upgraded rails, we’re able to do what we’ve always done, but at a higher level of efficiency, elegance, and clarity.

#### EACH FEEDBACK REVIEW SESSION RESULTS IN A FINAL REPORT THAT MAY INCLUDE:

- UX and usability observations
- UI/visual inconsistencies
- Bugs or performance issues
- Messaging clarity and tone gaps
- Suggestions for improvement and open questions
