  <summary>
    <strong>How long should I plan to stay?</strong>
  </summary>
  <p>
    The residency runs for a full month. Many citizens join for the entire duration, and most people who stay for only a
    week say they wish they had stayed longer.
  </p>
  <p>You’re free to choose the length of stay that fits your life, as long as it falls within the event dates.</p>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is the villa open 24/7 for coworking?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    No. The villa is typically open for coworking <strong>Monday–Friday, 09:00–19:00</strong>.
    It’s also home for organizers and some team members, so it cannot stay open 24/7.
  </p>

  <p>If you plan to work late or early, we recommend:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Booking accommodation with strong Wi-Fi</li>
    <li>Using cafés or nearby coworking spaces on evenings or weekends</li>
  </ul>
