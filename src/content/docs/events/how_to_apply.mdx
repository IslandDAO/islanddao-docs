To apply for the IslandDAO Event, you need **one requirement**:

> **You must hold an IslandDAO Gen2 NFT.**
> Your application must be submitted from the wallet that holds the NFT.

This NFT acts as your residency passport and verifies your citizenship.

---

#### Step 1 — Go to islanddao.org

All applications open and are completed through our official site:

<LinkButton
  href="https://islanddao.org"
  variant="primary"
  icon="external"
  iconPlacement="start"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
  Visit islanddao.org
</LinkButton>

---

#### Step 2 — Connect Your Wallet

When applications open, you’ll be prompted to connect the **wallet containing your PERKS NFT**.  
If the NFT is not in the connected wallet, you will not be allowed to finalise your application and book your spot at the event!

---

#### Step 3 — Submit Your Application

You will complete an application form directly on the site (or inside the IslandDAO App once the feature is live).

:::note
More detailed steps will be added once the application module is released.
