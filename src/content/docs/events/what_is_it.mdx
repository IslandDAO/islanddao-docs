The IslandDAO Event is where our network state comes to life.  
For one month, Solana’s most dedicated builders from across the ecosystem gather on an island to live, work, and collaborate under one roof. Past editions have taken place in **Crete**, **Koh Samui**, and **Mykonos** — each one transforming a villa into a temporary hub of governance, innovation, and community.

This is not a conference. It’s a coliving, coworking residency designed for deep focus, shared experimentation, spontaneous collaboration, and human connection.  
Everyone who attends contributes to the atmosphere — from hosting workshops to launching new tools, from coordinating governance sessions to organizing wellness activities. Every event is shaped by its citizens, not by rigid programming.

The result is a month that feels like a living network state:  
high-trust, high-density, highly aligned — and built by the people who show up.

### A Day on the Island

There is no fixed script.  
Each day evolves organically based on the energy of the group and the needs of ongoing projects. We maintain a dynamic daily schedule — updated and improved each year — but participation is always optional. You work when you want, join sessions when you want, and take breaks when you need them.

A typical rhythm might look like this:

**09:30** — Coffee at the villa and setting up your workspace  
**10:00** — Group workout or wellness session  
**11:00** — Coworking, building, or relaxing by the pool  
**12:00** — Workshop or protocol deep-dive hosted by a citizen  
**13:00** — Lunch together at the villa  
**14:00** — Coworking / breakout groups / pool reset  
**15:30** — Launchathon or demo session for a community project  
**16:30** — Deep work, collaboration, or governance discussions  
**19:00** — Dinner with IslandDAO friends at a local restaurant  
**21:00** — Villa closes; the night is yours — explore, rest, or keep building

Some days look nothing like this. Some days look exactly like this.  
What matters is that the structure serves the builders — never the other way around.
