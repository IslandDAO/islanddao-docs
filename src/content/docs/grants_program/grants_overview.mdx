IslandDAO facilitates access to **ecosystem grant programs** from the **Solana Foundation** and **Metaplex DAO**, helping builders, creators, and communities secure funding for open-source public goods.  
Our role is to simplify the process — guiding applicants, ensuring alignment with program criteria, and accelerating high-impact development across the Solana ecosystem.

Through our coordination efforts, IslandDAO has contributed to:

- **$200K+ in grants awarded**
- **35+ open-source projects funded**
- **20+ communities supported**
- **12+ countries reached**

These grants have powered tools, protocols, analytics, documentation, DAO infrastructure, and community-driven education that strengthen Solana’s global builder network.

#### Application Guidelines

To be considered for funding, applicants should ensure their proposals:

- **Define clear goals and success metrics**: outline the project’s purpose and measurable outcomes.
- **Include a transparent budget breakdown**: detail how funds will be allocated (development, design, operations, outreach, etc.).
- **Highlight team experience and expertise**: share relevant background and previous contributions to the ecosystem.
- **Demonstrate ecosystem relevance**: explain how the project benefits the Solana community or extends public infrastructure.
- **Provide a realistic implementation timeline**: structure deliverables by milestones or months.
- **Showcase past work or demos (if available)**: include GitHub links, prototypes, or other supporting material.

We invite **developers**, **designers**, **community leaders**, and **educators** to apply and leverage these programs to build lasting, open-source impact.
