**Decentragrants** is a Solana Foundation funding initiative supporting governance tooling and infrastructure across the ecosystem.  
Grants range from **$1,000 to $15,000** and provide direct support for builders advancing on-chain coordination and decentralized decision-making.

This program focuses exclusively on governance — from DAO primitives and security enhancements to new voting systems and coordination frameworks.  
Funding is milestone-based, with disbursements tied to specific development targets.

#### Key Focus Areas

1. **DAO Tooling Innovation**  
   Supporting new governance interfaces, treasury management tools, multisig enhancements, and composable DAO frameworks built on Solana governance protocols like [SPL-Governance](https://docs.realms.today/spl-governance) or [Squads](https://docs.squads.so/main/development).

2. **Censorship-Resistant and Community-Owned Systems**  
   Prioritizing open-source, permissionless tools — identity-agnostic authentication, transparent decision protocols, and SDKs that reinforce decentralization.

3. **Infrastructure for Scalable On-Chain Coordination**  
   Funding sustainable systems for proposal tracking, notification layers, and cross-DAO integrations that improve coordination and transparency at scale.

**Who should apply:**  
Developers, researchers, and teams building or extending governance tools, DAO infrastructure, or coordination primitives on Solana.  
Projects are expected to be open source, milestone-driven, and to contribute meaningfully to the broader governance toolkit.
