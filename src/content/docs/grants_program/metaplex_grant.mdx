The **Metaplex Grant Program** supports developers building applications, tools, and protocols that extend the **Metaplex** ecosystem.  
Grants typically range from **$5,000 to $35,000** and combine financial support with technical guidance, ecosystem integration, and visibility across the Solana builder network.

#### Funding Tracks

1. **Metaplex Core Grants**  
   For builders leveraging the Metaplex smart contract suite — including NFT marketplaces, minting platforms, and infrastructure projects that advance the [core](https://developers.metaplex.com/core) protocol stack.

2. **MPL 404 Grants**  
   For teams developing with the [MPL-404 Hybrid Standard](https://developers.metaplex.com/mpl-hybrid), exploring the intersection of NFTs and decentralized finance.  
   Example use cases include collateralized NFT lending, fractional markets, or tokenized governance mechanisms.

MetaplexDAO prioritizes projects that emphasize **composability**, **open-source contribution**, and **real utility** across the ecosystem.  
In addition to funding, selected grantees receive **technical reviews, ecosystem integration support, and visibility opportunities**.

IslandDAO facilitates this program by guiding eligible developers through the application process and connecting them to the Metaplex DAO grant streams.
