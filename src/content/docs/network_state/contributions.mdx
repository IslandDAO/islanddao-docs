Island DAO thrives on the contributions of its citizens. Community members can add value by proposing initiatives, completing tasks, or voluntarily offering services that support the DAO’s mission and growth. Whether it’s website design, partnership development, graphic design, feedback, or other creative and technical work, contributions follow a structured process designed to ensure clarity and accountability.

#### Taking Initiative

Work opportunities are frequently available within the DAO, and citizens are encouraged to take initiative. If you see a gap, have an idea, or identify a way to improve the DAO’s operations or services - act on it. Propose it, build it, or start a conversation around it. The strength of Island DAO lies in proactive community engagement. Every contribution, big or small, helps build a better ecosystem for all citizens.

#### Contribution Framework

- **Budget Proposal Approval:** A proposal is submitted and reviewed by the DAO, outlining the scope of work, defined roles, deliverables, and budget requirements. Once approved, it becomes the roadmap for task execution.
- **Managerial Oversight:** Managers named in the budget are responsible for coordinating work, tracking progress, and documenting task completion to ensure transparency and alignment with objectives.
- **Work Execution and Compensation:** Citizens assigned to tasks or voluntarily contributing within the scope of an initiative receive compensation upon successful delivery, based on the terms defined in the approved proposal.

#### Alternative Contributions

In addition to direct project work, citizens can contribute by generating revenue for the DAO; for example, by facilitating or selling feedback sessions, which bring USDC into the treasury.
