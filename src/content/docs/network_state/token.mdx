The $ISLAND (Formerly $DEAN) token serves as the cornerstone of IslandDAO’s decentralized governance framework. More than just a digital asset, $ISLAND empowers its holders with real influence over the future of the DAO. Every token represents a voice within the community, granting holders the ability to vote on key proposals, initiate governance discussions, and shape the strategic direction of the DAO.

Governance via $ISLAND includes, but is not limited to, decision-making around the allocation of treasury funds, approval of community initiatives, funding proposals, and upgrades to the IslandDAO ecosystem. This governance model ensures that decisions are made transparently and collectively, giving the community direct control over the evolution of IslandDAO. By holding $ISLAND, members aren’t just investing in a token, they are taking an active role in building and sustaining a long-term, community-owned project.

#### TOKENOMICS

To maintain transparency and trust, the design and parameters of the $ISLAND token have been made public. Below is an overview of its core tokenomics:

- **Token Name:** ISLAND
- **Ticker Symbol:** $ISLAND
- **Total Supply:** 100,000,000 ISLAND
- **Mint Address:** Ds52CDgqdWbTWsua1hgT3AuSSy4FNx2Ezge1br3jQ14a
- **Minting Status:** Disabled (No further tokens will be minted)
- **Ownership:** Renounced (No single party controls the mint authority)
- **Mutability:** Token metadata is mutable
- **Authority:** 7A6CrNWAFFBpQTBRo5fULibqqB3MouNLgbVBf8D3MJAx
- **Governance Use:** Yes – active governance participation and treasury control

The decision to disable minting and renounce ownership underlines IslandDAO’s commitment to decentralization and immutability, creating a fair environment where no central entity can manipulate the token supply. Meanwhile, retaining mutable info allows flexibility for metadata updates such as icon changes or URI links, useful for evolving branding and infrastructure over time.
