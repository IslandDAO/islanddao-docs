#### Why Join IslandDAO

If you’re looking to join something bigger than yourself — to **build**, to **govern**, to **belong** — IslandDAO is your home.

At IslandDAO you’ll be working alongside people who care about building, experimenting, failing, and learning together.

**We’ve already:**

- Organized real-world, month-long co-living/co-working events.
- Built a transparent treasury.
- Established a comprehensive governance structure.

By joining IslandDAO, you’re not just a token/NFT holder — you’re a **co-creator**, **co-governor**, and **co-builder** of something that merges on-chain and real-world impact.  
When you join, you gain **governance power**: you vote, initiate, and steer projects. Our processes are open, and your voice matters.

You’ll tap into a global network of builders, creators, and thinkers. Beyond the digital side, you’ll collaborate in person—attend retreats, demo work, and live/work in a builder hub.

Our ambition is rare: we are a **network-state in the making** — online, on-chain, and physical. We aim to crowdfund real infrastructure and hubs where builders live and work together.  
You’ll get benefits like membership access, governance power, NFT perks, exclusive events, and access to tangible real-world infrastructure.

Finally: **you take initiative.** If you see a gap, you build it. If you see an opportunity, you propose it.  
Bring your idea, your project, your energy and join us.
