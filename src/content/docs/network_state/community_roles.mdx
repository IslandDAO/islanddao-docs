#### DAO LIFE, ISLAND STYLE

Island DAO (formerly DeansList DAO) is a tight-knit, high-energy community of Web3 power users who believe in building together, learning together, and thriving together. Our home base is on Discord, where conversations flow daily - from discussions about governance and new Solana trends to helping new members find their footing.

Island DAO is a gated community as you’ll need 10,000 $ISLAND tokens to get through the door but once you're in, you're truly part of the Island. It’s welcoming, collaborative, and full of people ready to help you plug into the ecosystem.

We host weekly DAO calls where members catch up on all the action - earning opportunities, project updates, proposals to vote on, and progress from our in-house grants program. It's where voices are heard, ideas are shared, and momentum is built.

We thrive on contribution. Whether you’re proposing new ideas, tackling tasks, or just lending your skills to help the DAO grow, your involvement powers the collective. Governance here isn’t just a buzzword - it’s our heartbeat. Every decision is made transparently, with $ISLAND tokens giving you a real voice in shaping what comes next.

#### MANAGERIAL ROLES

Managerial roles are acquired by dedicated citizens who have demonstrated the capability of handling them. The managerial merits are acquired natively through the DAO and asset ownership. The minimum requirement for managerial roles among other things is to hold the ‘One of Us’ role.

Managers are responsible for thorough documentation, communication, and preparation around initiatives in order to facilitate a streamlined experience for our clients as well as our citizens. This includes creating docs and spreadsheets, scheduling live workshops or meetings, and a greater time commitment. Managers are expected to be motivated and organized, possibly available at short notice. Managers oversee initiatives, budget execution, and individual tasks.

These roles are:

- **One of Us** - Assigned to verified holders of the Gen 1 NFT. 
- **Discord Warrior** - Citizens responsible for the upkeep, structure, and moderation of the Island DAO Discord server
- **Realms Council** - DAO citizens who are members of the Realms governance council, playing a key role in on-chain decision-making.

#### NON-MANAGERIAL ROLES

Most roles available are non-managerial. These include, but are not limited to, providing feedback, seeking allocated initiatives (bounties), seeking grants, and providing DAO tooling. All Citizens are eligible and encouraged to seek or propose initiatives that will help grow our community, or improve the services we provide.

These roles are:

- **PERKS** - Assigned to verified holders of Perks NFT (Gen 2) verified by PubKey 
- **$ISLAND Holder** - Assigned to citizens holding at least 10,000 $ISLAND token. 
- **Designer** - Citizens with skills in digital design, UI/UX, or visual branding
- **Realms Round Table** - Core contributors designing and building the Realms Network State UI
- **Grants Team** - DAO citizens who make up the Island DAO grants team. 
- **Developer** - Citizens with coding and development expertise
- **Server Booster** - Citizens who support the community by boosting the Discord server via Nitro.
