At Island DAO, we don't just believe in decentralization, we live it. Through on-chain governance, we offer our members a way to participate in real, meaningful decisions, all transparently recorded on the blockchain. This is governance without intermediaries. Every rule is written in code, every action is executed by smart contracts, and every vote is a signature of community consensus Our DAO operates like a digital organization. It can own assets, initiate transactions, and upgrade smart contracts, all actions triggered only by collective agreement. Nothing moves without a vote. This structure ensures that no single party holds control and that every decision leaves a permanent mark on-chain.

On **Solana**, weâ€™re empowered by the SPL-governance suite, designed for speed, accessibility, and efficiency. With low transaction fees and rapid finality, our governance model is truly open. Anyone with the right to participate can do so without barriers, making voting more inclusive and active across the board.

Our governance interface is powered by **Realms**, the user-friendly UI for the SPL-Governance program. Through Realms, members can create DAOs, manage proposals, vote on initiatives, and oversee treasury activity with ease.

We defines our own structure: **voting rights** might be weighted by token quantity depending on the amount of $ISLAND token a member deposits or locked in realms, tokens delegated by one member to another, by NFT ownership (Our latest NFT Perks feature), or in some cases, evenly distributed per wallet. **Proposals** can be member-submitted or routed through a council, depending on governance setup. Once approved, the execution is handled entirely on-chain, automated, immutable, and free from human interference.

This is what we provide: not just tools or access, but a living governance structure where every decision counts, every action is transparent, and the direction is shaped by those who show up.
