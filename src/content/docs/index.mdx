# WELCOME TO ISLAND DAO!

#### Who We Are

We are **IslandDAO** — a community-first decentralized autonomous organization built to empower builders, creators, and founders worldwide.  
Our premise is simple: when everyone takes initiative, collective intelligence and real-world impact follow.  
We operate through **transparent governance**, **open participation**, and **shared ownership**.

We are building toward a **Network State** — a global, digital-first community that also establishes physical nodes of collaboration and infrastructure.  
In alignment with the concept introduced by Balaji Srinivasan:

> “A highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition.”  
> [Learn more → thenetworkstate.com](https://thenetworkstate.com)

Our vision is to fuse **on-chain governance**, **real-world spaces**, and **global community** into one ecosystem that lives both online and offline.

#### How We Do It

We live by the DAO principle: **anyone can propose, anyone can contribute, anyone can lead.**  
Our governance is bottom-up — members initiate projects, vote on treasury allocations, build partnerships, and create value.  
The community is the engine; citizens are stakeholders and co-creators shaping IslandDAO’s direction through on-chain decision-making.

Our network-state model is both **global and distributed**.  
[Digitally,](https://linktr.ee/islanddao) we connect through governance platforms and community channels, enabling seamless coordination and participation.  
Physically, we manifest through **co-living and co-working hubs**, **retreats**, and shared **infrastructure** that bring builders together across the world.

Our mission is to **enable builders everywhere** to access community, infrastructure, capital, and governance — empowering them to launch ventures, collaborate globally, and live the values of decentralization.

To achieve this, we:

- Build and support a global network of aligned creators
- Provide on-chain governance, grant funding, and shared resources
- Develop real-world collaboration nodes through events and residencies
- Sustain a treasury model and membership utility that keeps value cycling within the community

IslandDAO is a living experiment — an evolving effort to prove that a truly decentralized community can organize, govern, and build together across both digital and physical frontiers.
