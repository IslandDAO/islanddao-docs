# WELCOME TO ISLAND DAO!

Island DAO (formerly Deanslist DAO) is a service DAO consisting of Web3 power users who provide valuable feedback sessions, as well as a variety of other services and consultation to projects wishing to succeed in the space or simply seeking to refine their products for an overall better user experience.

To fully appreciate what we do, it’s important to understand the foundation we’re built on: the concept of a DAO.

#### WHAT IS A DAO AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?

A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, represents a new kind of organization native to blockchain technology. Unlike traditional companies or institutions, DAOs operate through smart contracts, self-executing code that sets the rules, much like bylaws or regulations in the physical world.

This smart contract governance allows DAO members to actively participate in decisions through on-chain voting, creating a decentralized, transparent, and democratic structure. In essence, **DAOs put power into the hands of stakeholders rather than a central authority, enabling collective action, automated financial processes, and fair distribution of rewards based on contribution.**

Service DAOs, such as Island DAO, are an excellent example of how DAOs are changing the way organizations function.

#### FROM DAO TO SERVICE DAO: WHAT SETS US APART?

Having morphed from a subDAO under Grape Protocol in 2022 to an autonomous network state of Web3 experts, Island DAO is notable for being one of the first Service DAOs on Solana. However, what is a Service DAO exactly?

Simply put, a Service DAO brings together specialists who collaborate to provide valuable services such as feedback, testing, and consulting to Web3 projects. The revenue earned from these services is pooled into the DAO’s treasury, which supports ongoing operations, infrastructure, and rewards contributors who actively participate.

Our network blends deep Web3 knowledge with Solana protocols to increase ecosystem quality and enhance user experiences. With the help of professional recommendation, this strategy guarantees that projects flourish rather than just get off the ground.
